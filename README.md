# AutoTeNPyWithSSH

**AutoTeNPyWithSSH** is a lightweight toolchain that integrates [TeNPy](https://github.com/tenpy/tenpy) configuration generation with automatic remote cluster execution over SSH. It leverages an MCP server to generate simulation configs, submit them to a remote cluster seamlessly, and includes utilities for testing and plotting results.
